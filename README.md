Real_Time_FaceRecognition_Surveilance_With_Email_Notifications is a project built based on the face_recognition libray,Flask,Opencv and smtplib libraries. The Real_Time_FaceRecognition_Surveilance_With_Email_Notifications trains over an existing image stored and compare the face patterns with another faces to see if they are able to match based on the Euclidean distance where the lower the distance between two different face patterns imply that the face are identical. The smtplib is used to send the identified image from the host computer which in my case is obtained through the webcam and sent synchoronously to the recipeint in real time as the png image attachment with the name and the duration which the person was caught on the camera
